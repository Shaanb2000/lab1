      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shaan Bhakta, a UC San Diego Data Science major passionate about
        using data, code, and design to solve practical problems.
        I love blending analytics and creativity to build interactive tools and visual
        stories that make complex ideas clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside class, I'm learning full-stack development (MERN) and building
        early prototypes like <em>QuantumLeap</em>â€”a project-based learning platformâ€”and
        contributing to a startup called <em>ArkireHQ</em> as a frontend intern.
      </p>

        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> building React/Node apps with MongoDB and deploying on Vercel or Render.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning Practice:</strong> exploring model training, feature engineering, and real-world ML use cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Thinking:</strong> crafting user-friendly interfaces that communicate data clearly and aesthetically.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interests & Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m interested in AI for social impact, startup innovation, and creative education tech.
        My goal is to become an applied ML engineer who bridges technical depth with human-centered design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy brainstorming new startup ideas, exploring visualization tools, and creating content that inspires others to learn by building.
